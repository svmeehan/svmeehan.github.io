I"<p>Last Summer, I began using the AWS ecosystem to host some personal projects. I fully intend to do a post about one of the Lambda projects I worked on last year but I want to rebuild it using the new lambda containers so I can do a comparison.</p>

<p>Amazon offers a number of options for certification <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">here</a>. Tshe basic</p>

<p>I have finally decided to book the exam. Thereâ€™s a few reasons that I decided the time was right to take the exam:</p>
<ol>
  <li>My access to the AWS free tier is almost up.</li>
  <li>Amazon do yearly updates to the exam and most of what I have learned has been for the 2020 exam.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve spent a not insignificant amount of hands on time with the product.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will be adding posts to the blog with a single post per technology (S3, EC2, etc). These notes may go beyond the scope of the exam, mainly some AWS CLI stuff I want to have at a convenient location for copy pasting. I will be updating this post with the links as i write them</p>
