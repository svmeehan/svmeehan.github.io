I",<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a blogging software that produces a static webpage. A static webpage is simply one that serves fixed html files. The webpage will never change unless the html files are edited. A dynamic webpage on the other hand can retrieve information from a database and inject the result into a html page before serving it - think search results.  Jekyll gives you the dynamic features you need - I donâ€™t have to add every new post I create to the main page - but every page is then built into a static html file.</p>
