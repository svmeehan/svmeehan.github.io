<p>Last Summer, I began using the AWS ecosystem to host some personal projects. I fully intend to do a post about one of the Lambda projects I worked on last year but I want to rebuild it using the new lambda containers so I can do a comparison.</p>

<p>Amazon offers a number of options for certification <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">here</a>. The basic cert is the ‚ÄúAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner‚Äù.</p>

<p>There are then three associated level certs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect</li>
  <li>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</li>
  <li>AWS Certified Developer</li>
</ol>

<p>There are then two professional level certs and six specialty certificates. I decided to skip the cloud practitioner exam and go for something more technical. While I was initially drawn to the administrator course based on my interests I opted instead for the Solution Architect exam. This course seemed to be the most fundamental with a focus on designing robust deployments and understanding of the most cost efficient solutions.</p>

<p>I will be adding posts to the blog with a single post per technology (S3, EC2, etc). These notes may go beyond the scope of the exam, mainly some AWS CLI stuff I want to have at a convenient location for copy pasting. I will be updating this post with the links as i write them.</p>
