I":<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a blogging software that produces a static webpage. A static webpage is simply one that serves fixed html files. The webpage will never change unless the html files are edited. A dynamic webpage on the other hand can retrieve information from a database and inject the result into a html page before serving it. Think of your google search results. The page always looks the same but the content between the header and footer is unique. Jekyll gives you the dynamic features you need - I don’t have to add every new post I create to the main page - but every page is then built into a static html file.</p>

<p>Let’s briefly discuss the Dockerfile and the choices that were made in order to get it working. The first choice we made was what image to use. Now I didn’t want to make my container from scratch (literally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM scratch</code> in Docker) so I took an official ruby image. I used the tag alpine so I could get a smaller version of Linux in order to minimise the final image size.  Originally, I had used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM ruby:alpine</code> which included ruby 3.0. Unfortunately, there was a compatibility issue with this version of ruby. Docker saved me a lot of time here as I could simply use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FROM ruby:2-alpine</code> instead and the image was rebuilt. Installing this locally it would have been a headach to manage ruby versions. I had this issue before when Python 3 was released and ended up with multiple conflicting versions of packages on my machine (I just use <em>venv</em> now).</p>

<p>I had considered replacing the line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RUN apk add gcc g++ make &amp;&amp; gem install bundler jekyll &amp;&amp; apk del gcc g++ make
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RUN apk add gcc g++ make 
RUN gem install bundler jekyll &amp;&amp; apk del gcc g++ make 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are not familiar with Docker and how Dockerfiles are built you may be questioning my sanity. “Isn’t this doing exactly the same thing?”. Yes but there are differences in the output. The second example may be preferable</p>
