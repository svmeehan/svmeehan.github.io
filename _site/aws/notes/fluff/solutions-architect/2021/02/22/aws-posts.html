<h2 id="exam-selection">Exam Selection</h2>

<p>Last Summer, I began using the AWS ecosystem to host some personal projects. I fully intend to do a post about one of the Lambda projects I worked on last year but I want to rebuild it using the new lambda containers so I can do a comparison.</p>

<p>Amazon offers a number of options for certification <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">here</a>. The basic cert is the “AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner”.</p>

<p>There are then three associated level certs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect</li>
  <li>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</li>
  <li>AWS Certified Developer</li>
</ol>

<p>There are then two professional level certs and six specialty certificates. I decided to skip the cloud practitioner exam and go for something more technical. While I was initially drawn to the administrator course based on my interests I opted instead for the Solution Architect exam. This course seemed to be the most fundamental with a focus on designing robust deployments and understanding of the most cost efficient solutions.</p>

<p>I will be adding posts to the blog with a single post per technology (S3, EC2, etc). These notes may go beyond the scope of the exam, mainly some AWS CLI stuff I want to have at a convenient location for copy pasting. I will be updating this post with the links as I write them.</p>

<p>The exam guide can be found <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf">here</a>. For the AWS Solutions Architect exam we want a good understanding of what constitutes an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html">“AWS Well-Architected Framework”</a>.</p>
