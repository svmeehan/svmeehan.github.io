The TLDR version is: notebooks come and go but a git repo lasts forever (including all spelling mistakes commited in old versions!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve played around a lot with AWS recently and built a few hosted webpages there. One was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; (node.js) blog using an EC2 instance as a web server with a RDS (MySQL) server as a backend. I also experimented with serving a static website from S3 using the API Gateway. In the end with my AWS free trial coming to an end soon I wanted to move to a lower cost solution (and by this I mean free). I actualy have some AWS credits for attending the AWS Online Summit last Summer but I’d rather save these for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/jekyll-install.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;You had me at free...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a Ruby gem, which allows a static blog to be hosted on github pages with very little effort. Until now, I’d been using my github.io site to host a wildly out of date webpage I created during a college course. The truly committed can probably still see it and while there were some features I was proud of it wasn’t really a good first impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to keep track of the new technologies I have learned. I’ve learned a lot of new technologies over the years but found it hard to retain this information in the long term unless directly working with them. As an example, last year I completed a few MongoDB courses (this is actually one of the best learning platforms I’ve used) but when I tried to build a Mongo cluster using Docker I found myself having to relearn most of the information from the docs. These notes should hopefully speed up the reaquisition of skills while the act of writing about a technology requires a deeper understanding which may also help long term retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I want to use this as a place to discuss the current state of the personal projects I am working on. This will probably overlap somewhat with the first point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my plan is to add a post detailing how this blog was set up and then to some info about myself in the “About” section.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="welcome" /><summary type="html">For this first post I am going to explain the motivation behind the creation of this blog.
