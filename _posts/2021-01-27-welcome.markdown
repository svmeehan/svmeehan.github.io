There are two intentions behind the creation of this blog. You won't find uch beyond personal motiations in this post so feel free to skip.

The first is to keep track of the new technologies I have learned. Over the years I have learned a lot of things but found it hard to retain this information in the long term unless directly working with the technologies. For example last year I completed a few MongoDB courses (they have one of the best learning platforms i've used) but when I tried to build a Mongo cluster using docker I found myself having to relearn most of the information from the docs. These notes should hopefully speed up the reaquisition of skills while the act of writing about a technology requires a deeper understanding which may also help long term retention.

Secondly, I will use this as a place to discuss the current state of any projects I am working on. This will probably overlap with the above.
