## Exam Selection

Last Summer, I began using the AWS ecosystem to host some personal projects. I fully intend to do a post about one of the Lambda projects I worked on last year but I want to rebuild it using the new lambda containers so I can do a comparison.

Amazon offers a number of options for certification [here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). The basic cert is the "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner". 

There are then three associated level certs:

1. AWS Certified Solutions Architect
2. AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
3. AWS Certified Developer

There are then two professional level certs and six specialty certificates. I decided to skip the cloud practitioner exam and go for something more technical. While I was initially drawn to the administrator course based on my interests I opted instead for the Solution Architect exam. This course seemed to be the most fundamental with a focus on designing robust deployments and understanding of the most cost efficient solutions.

I will be adding posts to the blog with a single post per technology (S3, EC2, etc). These notes may go beyond the scope of the exam, mainly some AWS CLI stuff I want to have at a convenient location for copy pasting. I will be updating this post with the links as I write them.

## The Links

The exam guide can be found [here](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf). For the AWS Solutions Architect exam we want a good understanding of what constitutes an ["AWS Well-Architected Framework"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html).
